## Terminal Command Guidelines

### Encoding Issue Workaround

Due to Korean character encoding issues in Cursor's integrated terminal, follow these rules:

- **All terminal commands and outputs must use English only**
- Never use Korean characters in:
  - `Write-Output` messages
  - `echo` commands
  - Variable names
  - File descriptions
  - Comments in PowerShell scripts

### Correct Examples

```powershell
# ✅ Good - English only
Write-Output "config: 6 files, 0 MB"
Write-Output "Total: 244 files"
foreach ($folder in @("config", "env")) {
    Write-Output "$folder : OK"
}
```

### Incorrect Examples

```powershell
# ❌ Bad - Korean characters will break
Write-Output "config: 6개 파일, 0 MB"
Write-Output "총: 244개 파일"
```

### Response Format

- You can explain results in Korean to the user in your response text
- Only terminal command outputs must be in English
- File counts, sizes, and statuses should use English abbreviations
